      <p>
        I’m a Frontend Developer focused on UX/UI design, building scalable and
        intuitive web applications with React, TypeScript, and a modern,
        design-first approach. I specialize in leading and developing Web Design
        System component libraries, built from scratch in close collaboration
        with designers. I’m also skilled at driving design system adoption and
        alignment by organizing and leading guilds, discussions, and recurring
        sessions that foster quality, consistency, and shared ownership across
        teams. I work closely with designers in Figma, lead cross-functional
        initiatives, and organize internal React and JavaScript meetups to
        strengthen engineering culture.

      <p>
        With a background in art history and curating, I bring a creative,
        detail-oriented perspective to frontend development.
